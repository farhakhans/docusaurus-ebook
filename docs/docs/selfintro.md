# Self-Introduction About My Project

My name is Farha, and I am currently developing a structured documentation platform focused on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Using Docusaurus, I have created an organized ecosystem that delivers clear, accessible learning content through chapters, lessons, and technical insights. My project integrates modern AI tools such as SpecifyPlus, Qdrant, Gemini, and Claude to demonstrate real-world applications of intelligent systems. The objective is to simplify complex robotics concepts while offering a high-value learning experience for students and developers. This initiative reflects my commitment to innovation, technical clarity, and future-focused AI-robotics education.
